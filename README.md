# Helmet â›‘ Detection

### One of the leading causes of fatalities in these accidents is the lack of helmet usage by motorcyclists. To ensure that motorcyclists wear helmets and over-speed, traditional methods include manual monitoring by traffic police at intersections or the use of CCTV footage to identify those not wearing a helmet and over-speed detection vehicle.
